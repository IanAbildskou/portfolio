    title: 'About',
    text: "Contrary to what the name implies, I am born and raised in Denmark.<br><br>Taking stuff apart and putting things together is a fundamental part of me; electronics, mechanics or software. I have since a young age built computers, bicycles, motorbikes, websites and apps.<br><br>Human computer interaction is fascinating to me, and I believe there is still much improvement to be done in this area. Because of this belief, I went to ITU to obtain a bachelor's degree of science in digital media & design.<br><br>With a theoretical framework for designing useful human computer interaction and practical know how for building software, I have spent my time building a multitude of products.<br>Including but not limited to: a learning experience platform, a gyroscopic synth controller, a self service B2B telco platform, a drinking game, a direct democracy platform, a marketplace for panamanian bus tickets and many more.<br><br>I have done so in large corporations, tiny startups and in my free time with friends. I have held positions such as UX designer, full stack developer, business analyst and account manager, often more than one at a time.<br><br>The interplay between what is useful for people and what is cost effective to build has driven me professionally, and it is my ability to navigate these dynamics that enable me to build great products.<br><br>Lately I have become interested in the business side of the industry. One thing is to build software, another is to build useful software, but how do you build a sustainable business model around it? How do you ensure marketability of your product? I believe this problem constitutes the third pillar of software; engineering, interaction design and business informatics. It also creates a “three body problem”, which is incredibly challenging to solve!<br><br>This is what, I want to learn more about in the coming years. I believe a sustainable business is key to sustainable software.",
