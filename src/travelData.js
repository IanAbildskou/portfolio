It was something I had wanted to try for a long time.<br><br>I bought a motorcycle and an old guitar to keep me company.<br><br>It was really interesting to see the holy land of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and so many other famous places. I even got to see the launch of a SpaceX rocket while I was there. It was such a surreal experience!",

I went to Australia for six months, to try my hand at jackarooing, the Australian version of a cow boys.<br><br>These days they donâ€™t use horses very much though. Instead we used motorbikes and helicopters. I was herding cattle in the middle of Queensland in 50 degrees heat. It was quite an adventure!",
