After that I visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Kobe and many other places. It was a great experience. Never have I met so many intersting and bizarre people and places in such a short time."

These days they donâ€™t use horses very much though. Instead we used motorbikes and helicopters. I was herding cattle in the middle of Queensland in 50 degrees heat. It was quite an adventure!"
