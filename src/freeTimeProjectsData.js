    text: "In 2017 a former colleague from ITU started a political party proposing direct democracy. The plan was to build a platform where people could follow and vote on proposals currently in the Danish parliament.<br><br>Really interesting project, that had a lot of traction in the media. I volunteered to build the back end as well as integrations to the parliaments systems."

    text: "My good friend and former colleague, Hari from Abtion, and I decided to build an online marketplace for bus tickets in Panama. In 2018 it was impossible to buy a bus ticket online in Panama. You had to physically go to the ticket office to do so.<br><br>We thought we could make that experience easier. It turned out that building the platform was the easy part! Setting up reliable payment gateways in central America is tricky."

    text: "In the spring of 2016 I participated in the IT case competition at ITU with Jakob O. Okkels and Olivia B. Nielsen. The case was about, how TDC, the biggest Danish telco provider, could meet the market with new IT initiatives.<br><br>We suggested, that they create and facilitate a platform, where users can exchange and broker their data in exchange for services, discounts and even money, to third parties.<br><br>We won the competition, and TDC invited us to their headquarters, to pitch the idea to their executive board. It was a fantastic experience, and we hope, they will implement our ideas some day."

    text: "While I was nomadding around California in 2018 I missed my musical instruments back home dearly. I wondered why instruments couldn’t be more portable.<br><br>I had the idea to use a smartphone as a synth controller. A smartphone has so many expressive sensors like the gyroscope, accelerometer touchscreen and so on. It even has speakers!<br><br>I had a lot of fun building and playing with the gyroSynth. It’s very tricky to calibrate the gyroscope across different devices."
