    text: "After the succesful case competition at ITU, I got a job offer from TDC Erhverv! I decided to try my hand at the biggest IT company in Denmark. There are a LOT of challenges working at a company that size, but once you're on the right track exciting things happen! I'm functioning as a UX designer and business analyst on our selfservice platform. Creating an interface for one of the oldest and most comlex IT systems in Denmark keeps your mind sharp!"

We recently opened up shop in Odesnse as well. It's a great place to work! We've got an office dog, named Muffi, in charge of HR, so working conditions are optimal."

These days they don’t use horses very much though. Instead we used motorbikes and helicopters. I was herding cattle in the middle of Queensland in 50 degrees heat. It was quite an adventure!'
